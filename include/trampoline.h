     * and provides access to both the original and detour functions. It is typically used in situations where
     * function behavior needs to be modified or extended, such as in software testing or reverse engineering.
     *
     * @tparam ReturnType The return type of the function being hooked.
     * @tparam Args The argument types of the function being hooked.
